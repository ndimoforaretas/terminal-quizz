## Code Explanation

The code is written in JavaScript using modern ES6+ syntax. The `readline-sync` package is used to handle user input in the terminal. Here's a brief overview of the main parts of the code:

- **Importing readline-sync**: The `readline-sync` module is imported using ES6 `import` syntax.
- **ASCII Art**: The `appTitle` constant contains the ASCII art for the application title.
- **Quiz Questions**: The `quizQuestions` array contains objects representing each quiz question. Each object has a `question`, `options`, and `answer`.
- **Menu Display**: The `showMenu` function displays the main menu options.
- **Quiz Logic**:
  - `startQuiz` function iterates over the `quizQuestions` array, displays each question and its options, prompts the user for an answer, checks if the answer is correct, and updates the score.
  - `startQuizGame` function contains the main loop that runs the application, displaying the menu and handling user input based on their choices.
